            <p class= "m-2">What can I say about myself? Well, I grew up in Aurora, Colorado and have lived here my whole life. I enjoy
                spending time with my dog Behr, who is a cadoodle (Poodle & Catalua mix). He's smart, stubborn, and all
                around fun. We hike and take trips to the local dog parks. Plus, he loves to learn new tricks. I've played
                on soccer, lacrosse, and hockey teams in the past, but now I've settled in to be a fan of both sports. I
                love that Colorado has the support to have our very own lacrosse team. I'm an easy going person. I care
                about wild places and their habitats, which is something I appreciate living so close to the mountains. In
                my free time you'll catch me golfing, hanging out with friends, watching hockey, or on a fun disc golf
                course.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="m-2">For the past 6 years I have ran my own company doing construction and remodeling. Before my company, I was
                the Equipment Manager at multiple golf courses. I attended college at Metropolitan State University of
                Denver for Psychology Human Development, The Art Institute for Animation, and now I study Web Development at
                University of Denver.</p>
